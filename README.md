# ml-pipe-tab
The idea of this project is to provide a robust and comprehensive skeleton for typical machine learning prediction tasks regarding tabular data. The pipeline will leverage mainly sklearn and include typical steps such as data wrangling, feature engineering, feature selection, model selection, training, and fine-tuning. It should serve as a set of util tools for kaggle competitions.
